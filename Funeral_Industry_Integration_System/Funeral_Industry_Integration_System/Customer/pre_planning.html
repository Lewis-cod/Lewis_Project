            <h2>Funeral Arrangements in Malaysia: The Importance of Pre-Planning</h2>
            
            <div class="intro-text">
                <p>Discussing death and the afterlife is often considered taboo. Many assume that when the time comes, someone will handle the necessary funeral arrangements.</p>
                <p>However, most of us have thought about how we wish to depart from this world—what our wake should look like, how we'd like our remains to be handled, and how we hope to be remembered.</p>
                <p>Death, however, often comes unexpectedly. Without prior planning, family members and loved ones are left scrambling to organize a proper send-off under significant time pressure and emotional stress.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-points">
                <h3>Here are three reasons why funeral pre-planning is vital and how you can approach it effectively:</h3>
                
                <div class="point-card">
                    <h4>Ensuring the Right Rites</h4>
                    <p>Religious and cultural beliefs greatly influence the style and structure of a funeral. For example, Buddhism, Taoism, and Christianity each have specific traditions and rituals for wakes and funerals. These may include the setup of the funeral hall and the prescribed prayer rites.</p>
                    <p>By pre-planning your funeral, you can decide in advance how you wish the proceedings to unfold—choosing the religious rites, the decorations for the hall, and other personal touches.</p>
                    <p>If these decisions are left to your loved ones, misunderstandings may occur. For instance, if your faith has not been clearly declared, or if you are a freethinker, your family might inadvertently follow rites that do not align with your beliefs. Pre-planning helps ensure your wishes are respected and avoids unnecessary confusion.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h4>Managing Budget and Expenses</h4>
                    <p>While funerals can be perceived as expensive or ostentatious, they play a crucial role beyond tradition. A well-planned funeral allows loved ones to grieve, find closure, and honor the departed through shared memories and respects.</p>
                    <p>By pre-planning, you can take control of the financial aspects of your funeral, ensuring it aligns with your wishes while relieving your family of sudden financial strain.</p>
                    <p>Setting a budget and organizing details ahead of time allows you to address potential costs and secure resources in advance. This prevents your family from shouldering a large, unexpected financial burden during an emotionally difficult time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="point-card">
                    <h4>Preserving Your Legacy</h4>
                    <p>How would you like to be remembered? Do you prefer burial or cremation? Would you like a traditional cemetery plot or a resting place in a landscaped memorial park?</p>
                    <p>Pre-planning gives you the freedom to make these decisions yourself. You can choose your final resting place, consider Feng Shui elements, arrange to be laid to rest near family members, or customize the décor of your wake and memorial. You could even commission a special commemorative tablet to honor your life.</p>
                    <p>These arrangements provide your loved ones with peace of mind, enabling them to focus on mourning, healing, and finding closure rather than managing complex logistics.</p>
